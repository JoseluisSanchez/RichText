RTF files can be read by most word processors, so this is a way to move fully-formatted information into word processor format, without lots of extraneous spaces and carriage returns.}\par\pard\f1\fs22\ql\li360\fi-360\sb576{\*\pnlvlblt\pntxtb \bullet}{RichText() isn't meant to be a front-line report engine, in its current form.  But it can be very useful for meeting specialized, custom reporting requirements.  If your app needs to generate true word processing files, this can be a useful, if slightly off-the-wall, approach.}\par\pard\f1\fs22\ql\li360\fi-360\sb576{\*\pnlvlblt\pntxtb \bullet}{In its current form, the system is very quirky (read: full of bugs), but it has reached a point where I think it can be useful to someone, so I chose to offer it publicly now.}\par\pard\f1\fs22\ql\li360\fi-360\sb576{\*\pnlvlblt\pntxtb \bullet}{The pages that follow contain some examples of the types of things that can be done with RichText().  Remember, RichText() is designed to link to a word processor, so its capabilities focus on standard word processing features, rather than the kinds of things that are important in a standard report generator.
